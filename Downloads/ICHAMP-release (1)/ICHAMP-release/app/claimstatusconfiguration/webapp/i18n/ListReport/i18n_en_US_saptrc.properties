# XTOL\u0009:\u0009Explanatory text for an UI element, such as a tooltip, input help.
# XFLD\u0009:\u0009Label for a component other than buttons and titles; sample components: column heading
# XBUT\u0009:\u0009Button
# XMIT\u0009:\u0009Menu item, either top-level like "File" or lower-level like "Save as..."
# XLST\u0009:\u0009Item in an enumeration, such as a list or a drop-down list
# XTIT\u0009:\u0009Title(or heading) of a non-actionable user interface element, for example, a column title, wizard title, or screen area title.
# XLNK\u0009:\u0009Hyperlink

# XCKL\u0009:\u0009Checkbox
# XRBL\u0009:\u0009Radio button
# XACT\u0009:\u0009Text with explicit importance for accessibility (sounds like cross-classification since, 
#\u0009\u0009\u0009for example, and "alt" text for a HTML-related image may be an "explanation" with special relevance for accessibility)
