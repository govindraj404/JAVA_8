# YINS	:	Instruction for a user, for example, a permanent text on a screen that introduces a group of fields.	
# XTOL	:	Explanatory text for an UI element, such as a tooltip, input help.
# XFLD	:	Label for a component other than buttons and titles; sample components: column heading
# XBUT	:	Button
# XMIT	:	Menu item, either top-level like "File" or lower-level like "Save as..."
# XLST	:	Item in an enumeration, such as a list or a drop-down list
# XTIT	:	Title(or heading) of a non-actionable user interface element, for example, a column title, wizard title, or screen area title.
# XLNK	:	Hyperlink
# XGRP	:	Group header or table section header
# XSEL	:	Selection, Values in a drop-down list, or a status.  For example: "In Process", "Shipped" or "Open"
# XCKL	:	Checkbox

# XACT	:	Text with explicit importance for accessibility (sounds like cross-classification since, 
#			for example, and "alt" text for a HTML-related image may be an "explanation" with special relevance for accessibility)
